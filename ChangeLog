Version 1.22 (2019-11-21)

 * Add support for SHA256 checksums, using jigdo format v2
   + Changes to libjte to generate the new format as an option - still
     defaults to v1 for cmpatibility for now
   + libjte updated to major version 2
   + Add support for v2 in jigdump, jigit-mkimage etc. too
   + Add new jigsum-sha256 program, for the base64-like output with
     sha256 checksums
 * jigdump now also understands jigdo .iso.tmp files
 * Misc small cleanups

Version 1.21 (2019-02-04)

 * parallel-sums:
   + New utility for calculating checksums in parallel
 * Misc code cleanups
 * Misc man page cleanups
 * jigit-mkimage:
   + Print missing file names correctly

Version 1.20 (2014-08-18)

 * mkjigsnap:
   + Add support for tracking back-references, i.e. which jigdo did a
     particular file come from.
   * Add support for verifying checksums
 * jigsum:
   * Add support for verifying checksums, similar to md5sum etc.
 * Misc code cleanups:
   * warnings

   + added -v (verbose) and -N (dry-run) options
 * Put AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR in a better place in the libjte configure
   script.
 * Remove -Werror from the Makefile - gcc is getting more and more
   pedantic with every release, and this may cause package builds to fail.

Version 1.18 (2011-04-30)

 * More dynamic memory handling in mkimage, instead of allocating
   fixed-size strings on the stack. Should now work on Hurd too.
 * Fix man page syntax errors.
 * s,config.h,../config.h, in libjte for easier use by the xorriso folks

Version 1.17 (2011-03-16)

   mkisofs/genisoimage. Now a shared library useable in xorriso etc.

   builds work better

 * debian-cd diff now includes updated grab_md5 and jigdo_cleanup
   scripts that must be used.

   jigdo_cleanup does the work.
